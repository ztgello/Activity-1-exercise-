  <h2>That Dragon Cancer</h2>
  <p>That Dragon, Cancer is an art video game created by Ryan and Amy Green, Josh Larson, and a small team under the name Numinous Games. The game is an autobiographical based on the Greens' experience of raising their son Joel, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer at twelve months old.</p>

  <h2>You Left Me</h2>
  <p>You Left Me focuses on a nameless female character who becomes overwhelmed with grief after losing a friend. She attempts to go about her day as normal, only to succumb to depression and eventually suicide. The game does have a light comedic tone to balance out the dark tones, such as a talking cat companion and the red moon resembling a clock face telling jokes.</p>

  <h2>Missed Messages</h2>
  <p>Missed Messages, you play as a college-aged girl living in one of her school’s dormitories with her roommate May. It’s a visual novel, like Butterfly Soup or One Night, Hot Springs, although at first blush it doesn’t necessarily look like it. The game opens with you waking from a dream and exploring your room. There are various objects you can click on, like plants or books.</p>
